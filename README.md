This is a GitHub Repository for the IDP3 Final Integrated Project

## FIP - MMED-1056 and MMED-1055 - Assignment Brief
Stendents must create a fully functional responsive website with some dynamic content
(HTML/CSS/JS/Image files, etc,). This will need to be maintained using Git for version
control and uploaded to GitHub by you.

### MMED-1056 (Web Development 1) and MMED-1055 (Multimedia Authoring 2)
Include the web-ready assets via the GitHub link as part of your submission
for this course.

### MMED-1055
Create some UI on the products / promotions page that can be used to load relevant information from an array. Think about
interactivity, micro-interactions / transactions, user experience, etc.
Your team can use a combination of advertisements or promotions and product features. Create an interactive graphic / icon for each
(create at least 3) and load content onto the page when the user requests that information. Consider scalability and responsive design
considerations for your graphics, and choose your format(s) accordingly.
**Option 1:**
Consider a “2 for 1” promo (or any other promotion of your choice). Create a “Click for promo details” button or graphic; clicking on
that graphic should retrieve the content for that promo from an array and add or replace existing content on the page using a lightbox,
popover, etc.
**Option 2:**
Create “hot spots” on your product images and reveal exciting information about a given feature on a click. As an example, you could
reveal information about the health benefits of Orbitz or Quatro using a series of clickable graphics overlaid on your product image.
For Both Options:
Store the text information for each feature or promo in an array in your JavaScript file. Develop a way to retrieve that information on a
user interaction (a hover, a click) and show it somewhere on the page. You can use a lightbox, a popover, a “see more” link… the UI
choices are entirely up to you.

### MMED-1056
Each team or individual is responsible for designing, coding, and semantically tagging responsive HTML5 website (using the CSS Grid).
CSS3 must also be adequately utilized throughout the site. 2 fully responsive pages must be completed. A contact form/page must be
present. No splash pages or single-page scroll sites.
Students are strongly encouraged to submit a fully completed design for their website. However, placeholder content such as stock
photos and roughed-out design files are permitted.
The 3-page website is based on the student's original layout (Not the templates provided last semester). Students are required to
create the proper markup for the site and must make use of semantic tags.
